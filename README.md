# SlidingPuzzle
The Sliding Puzzle Game is a console-based puzzle game developed in Python. It simulates the classic 3x3 sliding tile puzzle (also known as the 8-puzzle), where the player rearranges scrambled tiles into their correct numerical order by sliding them one at a time into an empty space.
